# Learning the Dockerfile Basics

I learned the Dockerfile basics using the default Dockerfile for the official nginx Docker Hub Repo.

Learned about:
- different stages of Dockerfile build stages and how it relates to docker image layers
- Dockerfile command references and where to find them in Docker official documentation.
