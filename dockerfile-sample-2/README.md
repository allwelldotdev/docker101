# Extending Official Docker Images

In this exercise, I learned how to build on top of a Docker official image for dev/learn or even sometimes prod work (although, this case always make sure to pin the image to a specific version number or tag).

I built an image from nginx:latest as base and a simple hello world website.

Built and pushed my [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/allwell/nginx-with-html/general) to the Docker registry (Docker Hub).
